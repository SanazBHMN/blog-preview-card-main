## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Only when I started to prepare myself to take LinkedIn's Skill Assessment Test for HTML5 did I found out that the team had decided to completely remove it. However, I tried to build out this challenge using as much semantic tags as I can think of.

It was my very first time using html `<time>` tag:

```html
<p>Published <time>21 Dec 2023</time></p>
```

### Useful resources

- [HTML Semantic Cheatsheet](https://learntheweb.courses/topics/html-semantics-cheat-sheet/) - I utilized this cheatsheet whenever I wanted to check the exact semantic of a piece of information I wanted to display.
